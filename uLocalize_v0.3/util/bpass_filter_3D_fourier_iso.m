%performns a fourier space 3d (xyz) bandpass filter on an image I and stores it into If.
%The filter shape in fourier space is stored in the image bp_filter

%cutoff frequencies:
%l_hi: lengthscale corresponding to the high frequency cutoff in pixel units.

%the lengthscale corresponding to the low frequency cutoff is defined as:
% cutxy*sigma_xy/dx     (for single spot detection, sigma_xy is the PSF
% width and dx the pixel size), so cutxy is the cutoff length in PSF width
% units

%fw is the steepness of the filter in frequency space in pix^-1

%filt_order is the order of the filter (the higher the order, the steeper
%the filter

%the filter has the shape of the shell of an almond.
%it is the product of two fermi dirac distributions (one for
%the low pass, one for the high pass)


%parameters that give good results for diffraction limited spots:
%cut = 3;

%sigma_xy = 2; (this should be the FWHM of the PSF in xy plane in pix units)
%sigma_z = 2; this should be the FWHM of the PSF in the axial direction in pix units)
